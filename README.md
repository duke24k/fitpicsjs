!!! Attention !!!

The algorithms work just fine, but all the drawing and smoothnes is not here yet.. Feel free too contribute ! this is open source baby !


Create Beautiful image galleries with pure JavaScript. No dependencies.

Currently supporting two strategies:
 - Linear Partition
 - BRIC - Blocked Recursive Image Composition

This library wont draw or measure anything for you, thats up to you and the library you are using.

You pass in a list of image objects, and you get back a list of image objects with recalculated dimensions ofcourse.

check demo files, this will be much smoother in the future..
